youtube-dl API
==============

Although now everything seems to be 'on the cloud' internet connection is not always
stable. So we want to watch and download videos, channels ot playlists locally to our pc.
The best solution I've found so far is `youtube-dl`. This enables us to download from
virtually any downloadable web link such as youtube, but also soundcloud, and most stream
hosters. `ydb` is thin parser which allows us to create easy lists in yaml and then let
`youtube-dl` to download them in bulk.
